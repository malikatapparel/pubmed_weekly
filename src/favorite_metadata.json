    "title": "The role of reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making frameworks in understanding food choice and eating behaviors.",
    "abstract": "The obesogenic food environment includes easy access to highly-palatable, energy-dense, \"ultra-processed\" foods that are heavily marketed to consumers; therefore, it is critical to understand the neurocognitive processes the underlie overeating in response to environmental food-cues (e.g., food images, food branding/advertisements). Eating habits are learned through reinforcement, which is the process through which environmental food cues become valued and influence behavior. This process is supported by multiple behavioral control systems (e.g., Pavlovian, Habitual, Goal-Directed). Therefore, using neurocognitive frameworks for reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making can improve our understanding of food-choice and eating behaviors. Specifically, the role of reinforcement learning in eating behaviors was considered using the frameworks of (1) Sign-versus Goal-Tracking Phenotypes; (2) Model-Free versus Model-Based; and (3) the Utility or Value-Based Model. The sign-and goal-tracking phenotypes may contribute a mechanistic insight on the role of food-cue incentive salience in two prevailing models of overconsumption-the Extended Behavioral Susceptibility Theory and the Reactivity to Embedded Food Cues in Advertising Model. Similarly, the model-free versus model-based framework may contribute insight to the Extended Behavioral Susceptibility Theory and the Healthy Food Promotion Model. Finally, the value-based model provides a framework for understanding how all three learning systems are integrated to influence food choice. Together, these frameworks can provide mechanistic insight to existing models of food choice and overconsumption and may contribute to the development of future prevention and treatment efforts."

    "title": "Identifying Young Adults at High Risk for Weight Gain Using Machine Learning.",
    "abstract": "Weight gain among young adults continues to increase. Identifying adults at high risk for weight gain and intervening before they gain weight could have a major public health impact. Our objective was to develop and test electronic health record-based machine learning models to predict weight gain in young adults with overweight/class 1\u00a0obesity. Seven machine learning models were assessed, including three regression models, random forest, single-layer neural network, gradient-boosted decision trees, and support vector machine (SVM) models. Four categories of predictors were included: 1) demographics; 2) obesity-related health conditions; 3) laboratory data and vital signs; and 4) neighborhood-level variables. The cohort was split 60:40 for model training and validation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated to determine model accuracy at predicting high-risk individuals, defined by\u00a0\u2265\u00a010% total body weight gain within 2\u00a0y. Variable importance was measured via generalized analysis of variance procedures. Of the 24,183 patients (mean [SD] age, 32.0 [6.3] y; 55.1% females) in the study, 14.2% gained \u226510% total body weight. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves varied from 0.557 (SVM) to 0.675 (gradient-boosted decision trees). Age, sex, and baseline body mass index were the most important predictors among the models except SVM and neural network. Our machine learning models performed similarly and had modest accuracy for identifying young adults at risk of weight gain. Future models may need to incorporate behavioral and/or genetic information to enhance model accuracy."

    "abstract": "Opisthorchiasis, i.e. infection with the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini is an important health problem in Thailand and adjacent Laos, and its control is therefore of high priority. Pilot projects have shown that after praziquantel treatment high re-infection rates occurred within a short period of time. To reduce re-infections it is proposed to couple the time of treatment to the seasonal transmission dynamics and thus treat the population in March when risk of infection for the snail and fish intermediate and the human definitive hosts is lowest. Adjustment would save costs and time."

    "title": "To what extent do EEG measures reflect performance in perceptual tests?",
    "abstract": "In many studies, EEG measures reflect performance in visual and cognitive tests, as determined by averages across different conditions or groups of participants. Based on these results, one might expect that there is also a significant correlation between performance and EEG measures at the individual level. In this study, we tested young and older adults with three visual tests while recording EEG. We analyzed 13 EEG measures, which were shown to reflect specific aspects of visual processing. Surprisingly, correlations between visual performance and the EEG measures were weak. Even more surprisingly, the EEG measures were highly correlated within participants. Our findings suggest that commonly used EEG measures mainly represent stable traits of participants rather than performance in the tests."

    "title": "Blaming the Brain for Obesity: Integration of Hedonic and Homeostatic Mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "The brain plays a key role in the controls of energy intake and expenditure, and many genes associated with obesity are expressed in the central nervous system. Technological and conceptual advances in both basic and clinical neurosciences have expanded the traditional view of homeostatic regulation of body weight by mainly the hypothalamus to include hedonic controls of appetite by cortical and subcortical brain areas processing external sensory information, reward, cognition, and executive functions. Hedonic controls interact with homeostatic controls to regulate body weight in a flexible and adaptive manner that takes environmental conditions into account. This new conceptual framework has several important implications for the treatment of obesity. Because much of this interactive neural processing is outside awareness, cognitive restraint in a world of plenty is made difficult and prevention and treatment of obesity should be more rationally directed to the complex and often redundant mechanisms underlying this interaction."

    "title": "Training motor responses to food: A novel treatment for obesity targeting implicit processes.",
    "abstract": "The present review first summarizes results from prospective brain imaging studies focused on identifying neural vulnerability factors that predict excessive weight gain. Next, findings from cognitive psychology experiments evaluating various interventions involving food response inhibition training or food response facilitation training are reviewed that appear to target these neural vulnerability factors and that have produced encouraging weight loss effects. Findings from both of these reviewed research fields suggest that interventions that reduce reward and attention region responses to high calorie food cues and increase inhibitory region responses to high calorie food cues could prove useful in the treatment of obesity. Based on this review, a new conceptual model is presented to describe how different cognitive training procedures may contribute to modifying eating behavior and important directions for future research are offered. It is concluded that there is a need for evaluating the effectiveness of more intensive food response training interventions and testing whether adding such training to extant weight loss interventions increases their efficacy."

    "title": "Containment and stabilization of bone graft in anterior lumbar interbody fusion: the role of the Hartshill Horseshoe cage.",
    "abstract": "The Hartshill Horseshoe cage is a titanium implant that is inserted after removal of the disc in anterior lumbar interbody fusion. The authors use corticocancellous iliac crest graft, which is contained within the confines of the implant. The cage and the motion segment are stabilized by inserting screws into the adjacent vertebral bodies through holes in the implant. Between 1995 and 1997, 27 patients had this implant inserted. Minimum follow-up was 2.1 years (mean: 2.9 years). Patients were assessed using the Oswestry disability index, a core set of six questions, a pain drawing, and psychometrically using the Zung Depression Scale and the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire. The patients' subjective assessment was also obtained. Twenty-one patients (77.8%) improved significantly on the Oswestry disability index and 22 patients (81.5%) improved by subjective assessment using the \"core set\" of six questions. There was no evidence of pseudarthrosis, loosening, or osteolysis around the implant or the screws. The cage prevents graft extrusion, collapse, or sinkage through the endplates. The normal lumbar lordosis is restored and, by restoring normal intervertebral disc space height, the Horseshoe opens up the neural foraminae. This cage stabilizes the motion segments and secures the graft, preventing micromotion at the graft vertebral body interface and providing a conducive environment for fusion."

    "title": "Dissociating neural learning signals in human sign- and goal-trackers.",
    "abstract": "Individuals differ in how they learn from experience. In Pavlovian conditioning models, where cues predict reinforcer delivery at a different goal location, some animals-called sign-trackers-come to approach the cue, whereas others, called goal-trackers, approach the goal. In sign-trackers, model-free phasic dopaminergic reward-prediction errors underlie learning, which renders stimuli 'wanted'. Goal-trackers do not rely on dopamine for learning and are thought to use model-based learning. We demonstrate this double dissociation in 129 male humans using eye-tracking, pupillometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging informed by computational models of sign- and goal-tracking. We show that sign-trackers exhibit a neural reward prediction error signal that is not detectable in goal-trackers. Model-free value only guides gaze and pupil dilation in sign-trackers. Goal-trackers instead exhibit a stronger model-based neural state prediction error signal. This model-based construct determines gaze and pupil dilation more in goal-trackers."

    "title": "Food craving in daily life: comparison of overweight and normal-weight participants with ecological momentary assessment.",
    "abstract": "The present study examined food cravings in daily life by comparing overweight and normal-weight participants right before eating events and at non-eating moments. It was hypothesised that overweight participants would have (i) more frequent, (ii) stronger and (iii) a greater variety of high-caloric palatable food cravings, and also would (iv) consume more high-caloric palatable foods, than normal-weight participants. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was used to assess food craving strength and frequency, variety of specific food cravings, and food intake. Fifty-seven overweight and 43 normal-weight adult participants were assessed at eating events and at an average of eight random non-eating moments per day for 2\u00a0weeks. Foods were categorised as: high-caloric high palatable foods (HCHP), fruits and salads, staple food dishes and sandwiches, and soups and yoghurts. Overweight participants reported more frequent HCHP food cravings specifically at non-eating moments than did normal-weight participants. Normal-weight participants reported more food cravings for staple foods, specifically at eating events. Moreover, overweight participants craved a greater variety of HCHP foods than normal-weight participants at both eating events and random non-eating moments. No other significant between-group differences were found. The results highlight the importance for obesity interventions (i) to specifically target high-caloric palatable food cravings that are experienced during the day and are not tied to eating moments and (ii) to aim for a reduction in the variety of high-caloric palatable food cravings. It might be fruitful to deliver treatment aimed at reducing cravings via mobile devices because this allows for easy individual tailoring and timing of interventions."

    "title": "Attentional bias to food images associated with elevated weight and future weight gain: an fMRI study.",
    "abstract": "Behavioral studies reveal that obese vs. lean individuals show attentional bias to food stimuli. Yet research has not investigated this relation using objective brain imaging or tested whether attentional bias to food stimuli predicts future weight gain, which are important aims given the prominence of food cues in the environment. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine attentional bias in 35 adolescent girls ranging from lean to obese using an attention network task involving food and neutral stimuli. BMI correlated positively with speed of behavioral response to both appetizing food stimuli and unappetizing food stimuli, but not to neutral stimuli. BMI correlated positively with activation in brain regions related to attention and food reward, including the anterior insula/frontal operculum, lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and superior parietal lobe, during initial orientation to food cues. BMI also correlated with greater activation in the anterior insula/frontal operculum during reallocation of attention to appetizing food images and with weaker activation in the medial OFC and ventral pallidum during reallocation of attention to unappetizing food images. Greater lateral OFC activation during initial orientation to appetizing food cues predicted future increases in BMI. Results indicate that overweight is related to greater attentional bias to food cues and that youth who show elevated reward circuitry responsivity during food cue exposure are at increased risk for weight gain."

    "title": "Sign-tracking bias is associated with the inhibition of motor response to appetitive food cues.",
    "abstract": "Response training, such as with the Go/NoGo task, reduces the value of trained items by requiring participants to repeatedly inhibit their responses to appetitive cues that typically elicit approach tendencies. This devaluation is thought to reflect a reduction in motivational conflict between the cue-driven approach and task demand for response withholding. In this registered report, we examined whether individual differences in Pavlovian learning style, measured via a sign-tracking bias during a separate Pavlovian conditioning task, are associated with the topography of event-related potentials recorded during a food-related Go/NoGo task. We also assessed whether this bias correlates with participants' reaction times and commission errors during the task. We found a covariance between sign-tracking bias and pre-training topographic electrophysiological responses during the P3 ERP component, but no association with training-induced plastic modification. Additionally, we found positive evidence for an absence of relationship between sign-tracking bias and behavioral responses at pre-training ("
